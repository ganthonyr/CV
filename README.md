# CV
This repo contains my CV and the code used to build it.

## A little presentation
I recently found the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package developed by [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild) and decided to explore it.
What I liked the most is that I got a nice CV for free, thanks to ideas inspired by other repositories (the links I leave for them in the respective parts of the code). <br>

So, I decided to share my code in case anyone wants to make their own based on the model I used. Also, this is the **first example of a CV in SPANISH** made with the <code>vitae</code> package.<br>
<br>
