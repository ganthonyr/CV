# CV
This repo contains my CV and the code used to build it.

## A little presentation
I recently found the <code>[vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae)</code> package developed by [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild) and decided to explore it.
The most important thing is that I got a nice CV for free, thanks to ideas inspired by other repositories (the links I leave for them in the respective parts of the code). <br>
Therefore, I chose to share my code in case someone would like to make theirs based on the model I used.<br>
<br>
You are welcome to copy the files and make your own edits.
